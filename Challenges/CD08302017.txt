B:

Cleanliness, you get the point. 

Input verification, I'll get the point. But I don't think that should be a criteria at this time... Just something that we can grow upon. 

Your range manipulation was stronger than mine I was a little fuzzy there. 

I got nested loops (Not actually sure off the top of my head if I coulda done it without the loops like your .repeat() ). 

You're lacking in comments but too many comments like mine actually kinda make it look a bit ugly.... 

Overall, +1 to you
