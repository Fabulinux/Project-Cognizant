B:

Cleanliness, you get the point. 

Input verification, I'll get the point. But I don't think that should be a criteria at this time... Just something that we can grow upon. 

Your range manipulation was stronger than mine I was a little fuzzy there. 

I got nested loops (Not actually sure off the top of my head if I coulda done it without the loops like your .repeat() ). 

You're lacking in comments but too many comments like mine actually kinda make it look a bit ugly.... 

Overall, +1 to you

==================

K:

Overall what we talked about, in terms of the loops here is the quick refactor I did

```python
n = int(input().strip())
space = ' '
pound = '#'
for i in range(1,n+1):
    sys.stdout.write((space*(n-i)) + (pound*i) + '\n')
```

Good idea on input sanitization! I just saw ( and added ) a challenge that was vague on the input and validation is a must!

I think your comments for the most part were good besides the new line and main? but I could see myself questioning what print "" in the future would be, so different use case would warrant it.
